<a name="headtas"></a>Contacting Course Staff
------------------------------------------

There are a couple of ways you can contact course staff or other students if you need assistance. Please do your best to select the method that best fits your issue(s):

- **Contact Head TAs (Email):** If you have a specific question about an area covered by a head TA (office hours, grading, regrades, homework), then you should first try to contact the head TA in that area (see table below for details).
- **Personal, Not Urgent:** For matters that require instructor or head TA approval (makeup quizzes, special circumstances, missing class, etc.) and are not urgent. Please submit a support ticket. You can do so by emailing [cs3120@cshelpdesk.atlassian.net](mailto:cs3120@cshelpdesk.atlassian.net).
- **Personal, Urgent:** Have an urgent and personal request that needs to be handled within 24 hours. Email Floryan directly and please label your email as urgent in the subject line so it stands out. 

<a name="headtas"></a>Instructor and Head TAs
------------------------------------------

We have one instructor and multiple **Head TAs** for this course. Their names and emails are shown in the table below. Each head TA is responsible for a specific category (e.g., quiz grading, office hours, etc.). Students should always **contact the relevant head ta first**, as the primary point of contact regarding issues in each category. Instructors are often slow at responding and the head TAs can more quickly address your concern or escalate the situation to an instructor if necessary.
