<a name="introduction"></a>Module 1 Review Topics and Example Questions
---------------------------------------

Module 1 involved a high-level discussion of what computing really means, as well as a review of proof techniques, cardinality, and other related topics. This list is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** and there may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an assessment:

- Any problem from any of the homework assignments on this module, including new problems that are similar but have slight variations.

- Discuss Input/Output of computers as Strings using formal notation and interpretation simple descriptions of alpabets and sets of strings. Example questions:
	- If $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$, then what do the following languages represent: $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^2 \ U \ \Sigma^3$. 
	- Write out a formal description of the following set (you may use set operators union, concatenation, and star if you want to e.g., $\{0,1\}^* \ U \ \{1\}^3$): The set of binary strings in which number of 0's is exactly three times the number of 1's

- Understand and describe the properties of functions:
	- Injective, Surjective, and Bijective
	- Give examples of functions with these properties
	- Given a function, explain which properties it has:
		- E.g., Consider the function $\mathbb{N}->\mathbb{N} \ \ f(x)=x^2$. Is this function injective? surjective?
	- Cardinality: Be able to count the number of elements in a set
		- E.g., How many elements are in the set of rational numbers in which the denominator and numerator can only be 1, 2, or 3?

- Create bijections between two sets to show they have equal cardinality.
	- Finite sets
	- Infinite sets
	- Argue that a provided bijection is injective and surjective
		- E.g., In class we saw a bijection from NxN to N. Argue, in words, why this function is injective.

- Understand and perform a proof by diagonalization to show that a set is uncountably infinite.
	- See example from class AND homework problem.


<a name="introduction"></a>Module 2 Review Topics and Example Questions
---------------------------------------

Module 2 involved the introduction of the DFA and NFA machines, including the class of languages they recognize (regular languages). We always introduced the regular expressions, a different way of describing the same class of languages. This list is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** and there may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an assessment:

- Any problem from any of the homework assignments on this module, including new problems that are similar but have slight variations.

- Understand and describe the difference between a function and a language. Describe how these are effectively the same but are presented in a different manner. Convert function descriptions into equivalent languages descriptions:
	- Describe the language equivalent of this function: This function takes in strings containing 0, 1, and 2 and returns true if the sum of the bits is odd, otherwise it returns false.

- Show an understanding of Deterministic Finite Automata, how they work / operate. Be able to:
	- Draw a DFA that recognizes a given language
	- Describe the language (as a regular expression) that is recognized by a given DFA.
	- Step through the computation of a DFA on a given input.
	- Answer questions about the limitations of DFAs

- Show an understanding of the formal description / notation for a DFA. Write out the description of a DFA using formal notation instead of a picture (graph notation).

- Show an understanding of the formal definition of a valid computation on a DFA.

- Do all of the above, but for an NFA
	- Understand and describe non-determinism, its benefits and limits
	- Design a simple NFA
	- Convert and NFA into an equivalent DFA
	- Explain / prove that NFA and DFAs are equivalent in computational power.

- Show a proof of closure for regular languages under union, concatenation, and star.
	- Prove closure under a new operation (complement, intersection, etc.)

- Read and write regular expressions as defined in this module. Answer any of the previous types of questions using regular expressions.

- Explain the proof that regular expressions are equivalent to DFA/NFA.
	- Prove a language is regular by providing a regular expression for it.

- Answer questions about the validity of the pumping lemma
	- Use the pumping lemma to prove a language is not regular.


<a name="introduction"></a>Module 3 Review Topics and Example Questions
---------------------------------------

Module 3 was a shorter module that discussed context-free grammars, push-down automata, and the pumping lemma for CFGs. This list is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** and there may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an assessment:

- Draw a simple pushdown automata for a simple CFG
	- Draw a pushdown automata for this language: $0^n10^n$

- Write out production rules for a simple grammar
	- Write out the Context-Free Grammar for the language $0^n10^n$

- Do the following for PDAs / CFGs:
	- Look at an example PDA and list the language it recognizes
	- Look at an example CFG and list the language it generates
	- Look at a PDA with a bug/issue and fix it
	- Look at a PDA and an example string and describe whether the PDA accepts the string or not
	- Detect whether a given string is generated by a given context-free grammar.

- Discuss the proof of equivalence between context-free grammars and pushdown automata
	- How do we simulate a context-free grammar with a PDA?
	- How do we simulate a PDA with a context-free grammar?

- Use the pumping lemma to prove a non-CFG is indeed not context-free
	- Use the pumping lemma to show that $a^nb^nc^nd^ne^n$ is not context-free



<a name="introduction"></a>Module 4 Review Topics and Example Questions
---------------------------------------

Module 4 introduced the Turing Machine and the notion of decidability. We also discussed reductions, and some computational classes (TM non-recognizable, etc.) This list is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** and there may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an assessment:

- Interpret a Turing Machine that is described or drawn in detail. What strings does it accept? What strings does it not accept, etc.

- Write a TM (in high level prose) that recognizes a given language

- Describe non-deterministic turing machines accurately that solve problems using non-determinism.

- Discuss the difference between decidability and recognizability.

- Discuss the definition of complement, and why the complement language can sometimes be harder to recognize than the language itself.

- Prove problems are undecidable through reduction.


<a name="introduction"></a>Module 5 Review Topics and Example Questions
---------------------------------------

Module 5 took a closer look at different complexity classes within the **decidable functions**. We started to look at time complexity as you have seen it in past courses, and break down major complexity classes that are important to understand as they seem to be on the edge of our current computing capabilities. This list is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** and there may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an assessment:

- State the definition, in multiple ways if applicable, of the sets P, NP, NP-Hard, NP-Complete. These definitions should be in relation to Turing Machines and how Turing Machines solve problems.
	- Example Question: What is the formal definition of NP-Hard? How does this class relate to the set NP? Explain your answer.

- Understand the differences between function, decision, and verification problems. Understand how solutions to one of these helps (or does not help) in solving the others.
	- Example Question: Suppose I have a decider for the decision version of traveling salesperson. How can I use this decider to find the optimal solution directly (the answer to the function problem, which is the length of the shortest hamiltonian cycle in the graph)?

- Understand the relationship between DTMs and NTMs and how they can or cannot solve problems in the different categories above in different amounts of time. Proofs of interest include:
	- If an NTM can solve a problem in polynomial time, a DTM can solve it in exponential time.
	- Verification with a DTM is equivalent to solving decision problem with an NTM.

- Understand and be able to explain the Cook-Levin Theorem and its proof of correctness.

- Be able to identify problems that are NP-Complete are prove they are NP-Complete:
	- Describe a verification algorithm for the problem.
	- Take a known NP-Complete problem and describe a reduction from this known NPC problem.
