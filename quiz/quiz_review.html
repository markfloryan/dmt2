1 Review Topics and Example Questions</h2>
<p>Module 1 involved a high-level discussion of what computing really
means, as well as a review of proof techniques, cardinality, and other
related topics. This list is <strong>NOT EXHAUSTIVE</strong> and there
may be questions on the quiz that do not cleanly fall into any of the
categories below. Students should be able to do the following on an
assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any problem from any of the homework assignments on this module,
including new problems that are similar but have slight
variations.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss Input/Output of computers as Strings using formal
notation and interpretation simple descriptions of alpabets and sets of
strings. Example questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline"><em>Σ</em> = {0, 1}</span>, then what
do the following languages represent: <span
class="math inline"><em>Σ</em><sup>+</sup></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>Σ</em><sup>2</sup> <em>U</em> <em>Σ</em><sup>3</sup></span>.</li>
<li>Write out a formal description of the following set (you may use set
operators union, concatenation, and star if you want to e.g., <span
class="math inline">{0, 1}<sup>*</sup> <em>U</em> {1}<sup>3</sup></span>):
The set of binary strings in which number of 0’s is exactly three times
the number of 1’s</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Understand and describe the properties of functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injective, Surjective, and Bijective</li>
<li>Give examples of functions with these properties</li>
<li>Given a function, explain which properties it has:
<ul>
<li>E.g., Consider the function <span
class="math inline">ℕ −  &gt; ℕ  <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.
Is this function injective? surjective?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cardinality: Be able to count the number of elements in a set
<ul>
<li>E.g., How many elements are in the set of rational numbers in which
the denominator and numerator can only be 1, 2, or 3?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create bijections between two sets to show they have equal
cardinality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finite sets</li>
<li>Infinite sets</li>
<li>Argue that a provided bijection is injective and surjective
<ul>
<li>E.g., In class we saw a bijection from NxN to N. Argue, in words,
why this function is injective.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Understand and perform a proof by diagonalization to show that a
set is uncountably infinite.</p>
<ul>
<li>See example from class AND homework problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

id="module-2-review-topics-and-example-questions"><a name="introduction"></a>Module
2 Review Topics and Example Questions</h2>
<p>Module 2 involved the introduction of the DFA and NFA machines,
including the class of languages they recognize (regular languages). We
always introduced the regular expressions, a different way of describing
the same class of languages. This list is <strong>NOT
EXHAUSTIVE</strong> and there may be questions on the quiz that do not
cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able
to do the following on an assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any problem from any of the homework assignments on this module,
including new problems that are similar but have slight
variations.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand and describe the difference between a function and a
language. Describe how these are effectively the same but are presented
in a different manner. Convert function descriptions into equivalent
languages descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the language equivalent of this function: This function
takes in strings containing 0, 1, and 2 and returns true if the sum of
the bits is odd, otherwise it returns false.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Show an understanding of Deterministic Finite Automata, how they
work / operate. Be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a DFA that recognizes a given language</li>
<li>Describe the language (as a regular expression) that is recognized
by a given DFA.</li>
<li>Step through the computation of a DFA on a given input.</li>
<li>Answer questions about the limitations of DFAs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Show an understanding of the formal description / notation for a
DFA. Write out the description of a DFA using formal notation instead of
a picture (graph notation).</p></li>
<li><p>Show an understanding of the formal definition of a valid
computation on a DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Do all of the above, but for an NFA</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and describe non-determinism, its benefits and
limits</li>
<li>Design a simple NFA</li>
<li>Convert and NFA into an equivalent DFA</li>
<li>Explain / prove that NFA and DFAs are equivalent in computational
power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Show a proof of closure for regular languages under union,
concatenation, and star.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove closure under a new operation (complement, intersection,
etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read and write regular expressions as defined in this module.
Answer any of the previous types of questions using regular
expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the proof that regular expressions are equivalent to
DFA/NFA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove a language is regular by providing a regular expression for
it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Answer questions about the validity of the pumping lemma</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the pumping lemma to prove a language is not regular.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

id="module-3-review-topics-and-example-questions"><a name="introduction"></a>Module
3 Review Topics and Example Questions</h2>
<p>Module 3 was a shorter module that discussed context-free grammars,
push-down automata, and the pumping lemma for CFGs. This list is
<strong>NOT EXHAUSTIVE</strong> and there may be questions on the quiz
that do not cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students
should be able to do the following on an assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a simple pushdown automata for a simple CFG
<ul>
<li>Draw a pushdown automata for this language: <span
class="math inline">0<sup><em>n</em></sup>10<sup><em>n</em></sup></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write out production rules for a simple grammar
<ul>
<li>Write out the Context-Free Grammar for the language <span
class="math inline">0<sup><em>n</em></sup>10<sup><em>n</em></sup></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do the following for PDAs / CFGs:
<ul>
<li>Look at an example PDA and list the language it recognizes</li>
<li>Look at an example CFG and list the language it generates</li>
<li>Look at a PDA with a bug/issue and fix it</li>
<li>Look at a PDA and an example string and describe whether the PDA
accepts the string or not</li>
<li>Detect whether a given string is generated by a given context-free
grammar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discuss the proof of equivalence between context-free grammars and
pushdown automata
<ul>
<li>How do we simulate a context-free grammar with a PDA?</li>
<li>How do we simulate a PDA with a context-free grammar?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the pumping lemma to prove a non-CFG is indeed not context-free
<ul>
<li>Use the pumping lemma to show that <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>b</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>c</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>d</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>e</em><sup><em>n</em></sup></span>
is not context-free</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="module-4-review-topics-and-example-questions"><a name="introduction"></a>Module
4 Review Topics and Example Questions</h2>
<p>Module 4 introduced the Turing Machine and the notion of
decidability. We also discussed reductions, and some computational
classes (TM non-recognizable, etc.) This list is <strong>NOT
EXHAUSTIVE</strong> and there may be questions on the quiz that do not
cleanly fall into any of the categories below. Students should be able
to do the following on an assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Interpret a Turing Machine that is described or drawn in detail.
What strings does it accept? What strings does it not accept,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a TM (in high level prose) that recognizes a given
language</p></li>
<li><p>Describe non-deterministic turing machines accurately that solve
problems using non-determinism.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss the difference between decidability and
recognizability.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss the definition of complement, and why the complement
language can sometimes be harder to recognize than the language
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove problems are undecidable through reduction.</p></li>
</ul>
